## How To Use
Press `Increment` to count. Increment is by 1. Press `Save Results` to record current count in the DOM. After saving, current count will revert back to 0. Beware: Refreshing will erase the saved results.

## How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Improve responsivenes
* Use local storage to record saved results. Add clear button to clear.
* Allow change of increment value. 
* Allow different starting value.
