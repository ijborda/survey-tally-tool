# Survie | Survey More Efficiently

Use [Survie](http://imarijoyborda.com/survie/) to assist researchers, data getherers/collectors, and students, in counting/tallying data during surveys.  

My motivation: Back in the day, I gather data with pen and paper. This is difficult specially if the setting of the survey is populous (i.e., on the busy street, restaurant, or stations). I develop this tool so that gathering and tallying of data can be done using phones on the go. The tool also runs purely on client side, so privacy of data obtained is ensured.

## How To Use
Press `Increment` to count. Increment is by 1. Press `Save Results` to record current count in the DOM. After saving, current count will revert back to 0. Beware: Refreshing will erase the saved results.

## How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/survey" title="survey icons">Survey icons created by Flat Icons - Flaticon</a>

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Improve responsivenes
* Use local storage to record saved results. Add clear button to clear.
* Allow change of increment value. 
* Allow different starting value.

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.
